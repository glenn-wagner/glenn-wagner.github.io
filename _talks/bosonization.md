Bosonization is an example of a duality---it relates fermions and bosons in 1+1d. In my talk, I will describe the bosonization formalism, in particular, I will motivate and offer a heuristic derivation (without detailed proof) of the bosonization identity. I will follow the constructive approach of van Delft and Schoeller. As an application of the formalism, I will explain the connection to Luttinger liquids.
