An introduction to categpry theory for physicists and the formulation of TQFTs in this language.

In today's journal club I will be talking about the formulation of TQFTs using category theory. I will give an introduction to category theory including the most important definitions and then explain how TQFTs can be viewed as a functor between two specific categories. I will then discuss the relation of this definition to Atiyah's axioms.
