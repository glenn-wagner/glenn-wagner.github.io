We discuss a theoretical model of an on-demand single-particle emitter that employs a quantum dot, attached to an integer or fractional quantum Hall edge state. Via an exact mapping of the model onto the spin-boson problem we show that Coulomb interactions between the dot and the chiral quantum Hall edge state, unavoidable in this setting, lead to a destruction of precise charge quantization in the emitted wave packet. Our findings cast doubt on the viability of this setup as a single-particle source of quantized charge pulses. We further show how to use a spin-boson master equation approach to explicitly calculate the current pulse shape in this setup.

In relation to recent electron quantum optics experiments we study a model of a quantum dot coupled to a fractional quantum Hall edge driven out of equilibrium by a time-dependent bias voltage. In this setup we take into account short-range interactions between the dot and the edge and calculate the time evolution of the current through the dot using a mapping to a spin-boson problem. Here we present the details of this mapping together with the discussion of numerical results, and their comparison with the perturbative calculations.

A-B stacked bilayer graphene has massive electron and hole-like excitations with zero gap in the nearest-neighbor hopping approximation (i.e., a quadratic band touching). In equilibrium, quasiparticle occupations are approximately determined by the usual Fermi-Dirac distribution. In this paper, we consider perturbing this equilibrium distribution so as to determine DC transport coefficients near charge neutrality. We consider the regime β|μ|≲1 (with β the inverse temperature and μ the chemical potential) where there is not a well-formed Fermi surface. Starting from the Kadanoff-Baym equations, we obtain the quantum Boltzmann equation of the electron and hole distribution functions when the system is weakly perturbed out of equilibrium. The effect of phonons, disorder, and boundary scattering for finite-sized systems are incorporated through a generalized collision integral. The transport coefficients, including the electrical and thermal conductivity, thermopower, and shear viscosity, are calculated in the linear response regime. We also extend the formalism to include an external magnetic field. We present results from numerical solutions of the quantum Boltzmann equation. Finally, we derive a simplified two-fluid hydrodynamic model appropriate for this system, which reproduces the salient results of the full numerical calculations.
