We discuss a theoretical model of an on-demand single-particle emitter that employs a quantum dot, attached to an integer or fractional quantum Hall edge state. Via an exact mapping of the model onto the spin-boson problem we show that Coulomb interactions between the dot and the chiral quantum Hall edge state, unavoidable in this setting, lead to a destruction of precise charge quantization in the emitted wave packet. Our findings cast doubt on the viability of this setup as a single-particle source of quantized charge pulses. We further show how to use a spin-boson master equation approach to explicitly calculate the current pulse shape in this setup.

title: "Driven quantum dot coupled to a fractional quantum Hall edge"
collection: publications

In relation to recent electron quantum optics experiments we study a model of a quantum dot coupled to a fractional quantum Hall edge driven out of equilibrium by a time-dependent bias voltage. In this setup we take into account short-range interactions between the dot and the edge and calculate the time evolution of the current through the dot using a mapping to a spin-boson problem. Here we present the details of this mapping together with the discussion of numerical results, and their comparison with the perturbative calculations.
