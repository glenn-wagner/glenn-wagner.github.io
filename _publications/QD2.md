In relation to recent electron quantum optics experiments we study a model of a quantum dot coupled to a fractional quantum Hall edge driven out of equilibrium by a time-dependent bias voltage. In this setup we take into account short-range interactions between the dot and the edge and calculate the time evolution of the current through the dot using a mapping to a spin-boson problem. Here we present the details of this mapping together with the discussion of numerical results, and their comparison with the perturbative calculations.
