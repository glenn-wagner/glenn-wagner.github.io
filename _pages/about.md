I am a third year graduate student working in Prof Steve Simon's research group. I am working on strongly correlated electron systems, in particular Graphene and Quantum Hall Edges. 

Quantum Hall
======
The quantum Hall effect is observed when electrons are confined to a two-dimensional quantum well and subjected to strong magnetic fields. 

Graphene
======
Graphene is a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms. 

Single-particle sources
======
Single-particle sources are currently of great interest in quantum information and other applications. We study a proposal for an on-demand single-particle source that uses a driven quantum dot to produce a current pulse on an integer or fractional quantum Hall edge. As the energy of the quantum dot is varied, a single electron or fractional quantum Hall quasiparticle can jump off the dot onto the edge and produce a current pulse. In the ideal case, this pulse contains a single electron or quasiparticle charge. However, we show that the ubiquitous Coulomb interactions between the charge on the dot and the edge will renormalize the charge in the pulse. This destroys the precise charge quantization of the pulses. Our model for the single-particle source can be mapped exactly to the well-known spin-boson model and we discuss the usefulness of this mapping. We apply numerical techniques used in the study of the spin-boson model to calculate the profile of the current pulses on the edge for two driving protocols of the quantum dot. From the Landau-Zener result, we discover a further impediment to quantized charge pulses. We discuss other proposals that do not suffer from the same drawbacks.
