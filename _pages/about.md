I am a third year graduate student working in Prof Steve Simon's research group. I am working on strongly correlated electron systems, in particular Graphene and Quantum Hall Edges. 

Quantum Hall
======
The quantum Hall effect is observed when electrons are confined to a two-dimensional quantum well and subjected to strong magnetic fields. 

Graphene
======
Graphene is a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms.
